I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in computer science at Harvard University where I work with [Prof. Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). I completed my PhD at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/en) & [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), Switzerland, where I was advised by [Prof. Fran√ßois Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). 

[//]: # (Before this, I completed my Masters (by Research) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/). During my PhD, I interned at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam, where I worked with [Tijmen Blankevoort](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijmen-blankevoort-a5633a24/).)

I am interested in mathematically and scientifically understanding deep models and their associated learning algorithms, usually through the lens of **interpretability**, **robustness** and **computational efficiency** of models.
