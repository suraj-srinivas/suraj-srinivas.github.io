I am a machine learning researcher working on model interpretability and data-centric machine learning. I am interested in (1) models whose functionality can be modified by directly editing their computational graph; and (2) models that can "cite their sources", by reliably attributing outputs to their training data. 

In the past, I have also worked on feature attribution, model robustness and computational efficiency of machine learning models. For more information, please see my <a href="/publications.html">publications</a>.

I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow with [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/) at Harvard University. Before this, I completed my PhD with [Fran√ßois Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/), at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/en) & [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), Switzerland.

 
I am an organizer on:
- the [theory of interpretable AI](https://tverven.github.io/tiai-seminar/) online seminar series, where we bring in interesting guests to talk about advances in the theory of interpretability
- [XAI in Action: Past, Present and Future](https://xai-in-action.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2023, where we focussed on the practical applications of explainable AI 
- [Interpretable AI: Past, Present and Future](https://interpretable-ai-workshop.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2024, where we focussed on interpretability for large-scale AI models

I also helped teach an [explainable AI](https://interpretable-ml-class.github.io/) course at Harvard during spring 2023.
