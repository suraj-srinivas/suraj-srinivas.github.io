\maketitle

I have accumulated substantial teaching and mentoring experience during my time at Indian Institute of Science (IISc), 
EPFL and Harvard. During my masters programme at IISc, I was lucky to have the experience of mentoring two undergraduate 
research assistants, under the guidance of Prof. Venkatesh Babu.
