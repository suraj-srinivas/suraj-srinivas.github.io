## **About me**

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University where I work with [Prof. Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/) on the interpretability and robustness of deep learning models. 

I completed my PhD at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/en) & [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/) in Switzerland, where I was advised by [Prof. Fran√ßois Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). Before this, I completed my Masters (by Research) at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ac.in/) advised by [Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/).

During my PhD, I interned at Qualcomm AI Research in Amsterdam, where I worked with [Tijmen Blankevoort](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tijmen-blankevoort-a5633a24/).

## **Research**

I am broadly interested in mathematically and scientifically understanding deep learning models, and using this understanding to better apply them to real world applications. My research so far has focussed on the **robustness**, **interpretability** and **efficiency** of models at test time, but I am also interested in topics such as score-based generative modelling, and self-supervised representation learning. I am particularly interested in applications of machine learning in impactful domains such as healthcare and robotics. Some projects I have worked on in the past:
- understanding why gradients of deep classifiers are perceptually aligned with human perception ([1](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dYeAHXnpWJ4), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19101))
- providing a mathematical unification of feature attribution methods ([3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01254))  
- proposing a method to train low-curvature neural nets that are "as linear as possible" ([4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07144)) 

My <a href="/publications.html">publications</a> page contains more information.
