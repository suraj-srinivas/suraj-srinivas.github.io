I am a machine learning researcher, with active research interests in  interpretability, data-centric machine learning, and training dynamics of large language models. I am ultimately interested in (1) models whose functionality can be modified by directly editing their computational graph; and (2) models that can "cite their sources", by reliably attributing outputs to their training data. **If you are looking to collaborate on these topics, feel free to drop an email**.

In the past, I have also worked on feature attribution, model robustness and computational efficiency of machine learning models. For more information, please see my <a href="/publications.html">publications</a>.

I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow in computer science at Harvard University where I worked with [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). I completed my PhD from [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/en) & [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), Switzerland, advised by [Fran√ßois Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). 

 
I am an organizer on:
- the [theory of interpretable AI](https://tverven.github.io/tiai-seminar/) online seminar series, where we bring in interesting guests to talk about advances in the theory of interpretability
- [XAI in Action: Past, Present and Future](https://xai-in-action.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2023, where we focussed on the practical applications of explainable AI 
- [Interpretable AI: Past, Present and Future](https://interpretable-ai-workshop.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2024, where we focussed on interpretability for large-scale AI models

I also helped teach an [explainable AI](https://interpretable-ml-class.github.io/) course at Harvard during spring 2023.
