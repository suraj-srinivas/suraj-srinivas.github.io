I am a research scientist at Robert Bosch LLC, Sunnyvale, USA, where I develop machine learning and computer vision methods for problems in autonomous driving, and industrial manufacturing.

My research interests include model interpretability, data-centric machine learning, and more broadly, the "science" of deep learning, i.e., understanding mechanisms driving model behaviour. For more information, please see my <a href="/research_themes.html">research themes</a> and <a href="/publications.html">publications</a>.

I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow with [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/) at Harvard University. I completed my PhD with [Fran√ßois Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/), at [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/en) & [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), Switzerland.

 
I am/was an organizer on:
- the [theory of interpretable AI](https://tverven.github.io/tiai-seminar/) online seminar series, where we bring in interesting guests to talk about advances in the theory of interpretability
- [XAI in Action: Past, Present and Future](https://xai-in-action.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2023, where we focussed on the practical applications of explainable AI 
- [Interpretable AI: Past, Present and Future](https://interpretable-ai-workshop.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2024, where we focussed on interpretability for large-scale AI models

**Note**: If you are looking for a research mentorship / collaboration on interpretability or the "science" of deep learning, feel free to reach out!
