I am a postdoctoral research fellow in computer science at Harvard University where I work with [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). I completed my PhD from [Idiap Research Institute](http://www.idiap.ch/en) & [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), Switzerland, advised by [Fran√ßois Fleuret](https://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). 

I am interested in mathematically and scientifically understanding deep learning, usually through the lens of **interpretability**, **robustness** and **computational efficiency** of models. For more details, please see my latest <a href="/publications.html">publications</a>. 

I am an organizer on the [Theory of Interpretable AI](https://tverven.github.io/tiai-seminar/) online seminar series, and previously for the [XAI in Action](https://xai-in-action.github.io/) workshop at NeurIPS 2023. I was involved also in teaching an [interpretable ML](https://interpretable-ml-class.github.io/) course at Harvard during spring 2023.
