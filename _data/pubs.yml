    title: Which Models have Perceptually-Aligned Gradients? An Explanation via Off-Manifold Robustness
    tldr: Previous work has identified the phenomenon of "perceptually aligned gradients" of robust models. In this work, we explain this phenomenon by observing that robust models in practice are not robust in all directions, in fact they are mostly only robust outside the data manifold. This causes their gradients to align with the manifold, causing them to be perceptually aligned.

    title: Discriminative Feature Attributions, A Bridge between Post Hoc Explainability and Inherent Interpretability
    tldr: If an input feature is unimportant according to a model, then removing that feature shouldn't affect model outputs. We train "inherently interpretable" models that have this property!

    title: Word-Level Explanations for Analyzing Bias in Text-to-Image Models
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05500
    tldr: For text to image models, we find which input words contribute to bias in output images. For example, we find that the word "doctor" in the input leads to an over-representation of males in the output.

    title: On Minimizing the Impact of Dataset Shifts on Actionable Explanations
    tldr: How to train classifiers such that they are unaffected by small shifts in the dataset? We show theoretically and experimentally that weight decay, model curvature and robustness are all important factors that can help minimize the impact of such dataset shifts.

    title: Which Explanation Should I Choose? A Function Approximation Perspective to Characterizing Post hoc Explanations
    tldr: Several popular post-hoc explanations such as LIME, SHAP, and gradient based explanations can be viewed as performing local function approximation (LFA). Thinking of LFA as a framework for explanations enables us to make useful statements in general about explanations such as a no-free lunch theorem, and identify which explanations to use.

    title: Efficiently Training Low-Curvature Neural Networks
    tldr: Train low-curvature neural networks, that are "as linear as possible" by (1) replacing ReLU with a variant of softplus, (2) spectral normalization of linear layers, (3) (optionally) using gradient-norm regularization. This approach rivals adversarial training without training with adversarial examples.

    title: Cyclical Pruning for Sparse Neural Networks
    tldr: Algorithms for training sparse neural networks should be more like projected gradient descent / iterative hard thresholding, which alternates between sparsification (i.e., projection step) and densification (i.e., gradient step), as opposed to common pruning approaches which do not perform densification.

    title: Rethinking the Role of Gradient-based Attribution Methods for Model Interpretability
    tldr: Commonly used input-gradient saliency maps for explaining discriminative neural nets capture information about an implicit density model, rather than that of the underlying discriminative model which it is intended to explain.

    tldr: Compute saliency information from all intermediate layers in neural networks, rather than just from the input, as is done commonly. This provably captures two desirable properties (sensitivity and completeness) which typical saliency maps cannot capture.
